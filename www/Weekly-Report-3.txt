During the third week of our project (March 5-11, 2025), our team deepened our understanding of the codebase through comments, diagrams, and meetings with former team members. Joseph researched Kria Board components for our assignment, created a slide deck, and explored Xilinx Vitis, while Tyler met with Mason Inman and our client to discuss algorithm environment setup and quantization needs. Conner built the Petalinux OS, wrote nix derivations for multithreaded builds, created a data version control presentation, and gave a lightning talk on U-Net architecture. Aidan connected with last semester's multithreaded programming developer, reviewed previous presentations, and tested matrix implementations to better understand the algorithm. Though we're still waiting for the Kria Board and need to complete environment setup, we collectively invested 17 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 62 hours) and have clear plans to advance our work in the upcoming week.
