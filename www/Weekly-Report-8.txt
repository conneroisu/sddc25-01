During our eighth week (April 15-22, 2025), the team moved from evaluation to implementation as we transitioned to the next phase of the project. Joseph continued RAM benchmarking and testing on the Kria Board to further optimize performance. Tyler successfully presented his research findings to both the team and client, gaining approval to begin coding the model division that forms the core of our optimized implementation. Conner documented comprehensive benchmark results for RAM and on-chip memory in the main repository, complete with code used to generate and graph these findings, and has begun more focused testing on ONNX runtime inference for our U-Net model. Aidan scheduled a one-on-one meeting with an advisor after previous outreach attempts failed, continuing his research on cv::mat implementation within the codebase while developing a better understanding of board operations. The team faces two key pending issues: Conner needs access to the actual ONNX running code rather than using personal models, and Aidan is working to find the right specialist for data structure consultation. After investing 17 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 184 hours), we're focusing on ONNX model testing, finalizing the model division implementation, preparing for semester-end presentations, and consulting with domain specialists to refine our approach.
