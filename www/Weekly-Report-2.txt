Our team began onboarding into specialized project areas during the second week (Feb 25-Mar 4, 2025), with each member making progress in their designated roles: Joseph studied the Kria board specifications and memory optimization, Tyler met with the current ISU team and familiarized himself with ONNX files, Conner established communications with Oregon State, set up Docker environments, created GitHub infrastructure, and prepared for model partitioning across the MPU, while Aidan shifted focus to understanding the multi-threading implementation in the C++ codebase for image processing optimization. Several pending issues remain, including hardware delivery, GitHub access, data vendor decisions, and C++ knowledge gaps, but everyone contributed approximately six hours each this week and has clear plans for continued progress in the coming week.
