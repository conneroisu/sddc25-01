In our fifth week (March 26-April 1, 2025), the team met to evaluate a new data version control system while making progress on software installations for properly running and visualizing the Kria board operations. Joseph successfully downloaded the correct Vitis AI version and got the Kria board operational with login requirements. Tyler researched optimization techniques specifically for U-Nets and CNNs on embedded systems. Conner fixed and improved the broken Docker development environment, making it more configurable, testing it across multiple platforms with GitHub Actions, and submitted PRs for both this fix and a slide deck presenting his data version control system proposal. Aidan formulated test equations for the multi-threading system and consulted with the previous codebase owner to validate his approach. The team faces several pending issues, including the desire for camera integration to visualize output, optimization technique selection, installer download automation, and reconciling conflicting advice on testing methodologies. After investing 25 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 114 hours), we plan to run benchmark tests, analyze the computational complexity of the existing model, test the unmodified model on the board, and research the cv::mat class to resolve testing discrepancies.
