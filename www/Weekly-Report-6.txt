During the sixth week of our project (April 2-8, 2025), our team focused on further optimizing the Kria board while advancing research on model splitting to improve computational efficiency. Joseph studied memory flow optimization for the Kria board. Tyler continued researching computational complexity and began creating a slide deck to propose a strategic model split. Conner built Petalinux configurations to run the previous team's code and experimented with OpenCV C++ to support development efforts. Aidan continued research on the cv::mat class, re-theorized the algorithm input structure, and held one-on-one meetings with both the client and past developers. We faced some challenges, including awaiting Petalinux configurations from Oregon State and Aidan discovering that his previous understanding of the threading system was incorrect, requiring a theory redesign. After contributing 19 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 133 hours), our team's upcoming plans include finalizing benchmark testing of the old code, presenting the proposed model division to the client, testing the custom Petalinux images with previous code, and developing a test input in cv::mat format to identify flaws in the current system.
