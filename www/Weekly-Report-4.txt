During our fourth week (March 12-25, 2025), our team made significant progress as the hardware finally arrived, allowing us to transition from theoretical learning to hands-on experimentation. Joseph finalized component selections for the project and studied data flow through the Kria Board. Tyler successfully configured the Vitis-AI docker container and trained the existing model to demonstrate proper environment setup to the client. Conner created a test application that split a PyTorch segmentation model into separate encoder and decoder ONNX models, noting decreased latency but increased throughput for multicore processing. Aidan continued close collaboration with the previous codebase owner while developing matrix equations for the multithreaded pipeline and becoming familiar with the cv::mat class. The team collectively invested 27 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 89 hours), and we're now focused on practical testing with the hardware, optimizing the model for pipeline division, experimenting with priority execution, and modifying the threading architecture for optimal performance in our pipelined structure.
