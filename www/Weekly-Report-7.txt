In our seventh week (April 9-15, 2025), our team made significant progress on benchmarking and technical documentation while preparing for future implementation. Joseph worked with Conner to benchmark memory performance on the Kria board, specifically measuring data transfer rates between L1/L2 caches and RAM while exploring optimization strategies. Tyler completed his computational complexity analysis and prepared a presentation for both the team and client to propose his algorithm division approach. Conner produced an impressive 36-page memory benchmark documentation with approximately 12 graphs, complete with code examples (using Python for plotting, C for benchmarking, and Markdown for documentation) and submitted this comprehensive report as a pull request to the repository. Aidan reached out to a professor for expert consultation on optimal data structures for our implementation while continuing his theoretical work on designing inputs for thread testing and visualization. The team collectively invested 34 hours this week (bringing our cumulative total to 167 hours) and plans to continue benchmarking, present the algorithm division proposal, test multicore ONNX model loading on the FPGA board, set up an SSH server, and consult with faculty experts on data structure options for the `cv::mat` implementation.
